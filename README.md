## How to use

To use this repository for making Shopify themes, use the following command of Shopify CLI.
```sh
shopify theme init [ NAME OF YOUR THEME ] --clone-url gh repo clone manishkodeglobe/E-Store-Shopify
```

If you don't have Shopify CLI installed to your computer, navigate to the [installation page of Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/installation).

## Not a student

If you're not a student, you can still use this repository to start a new Shopify theme project. However, any issues that you will encounter throughout your development will not be supported as the instructor will only answer questions through the course's QnA page.
